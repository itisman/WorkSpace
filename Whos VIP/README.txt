The concept of whos VIP is a platform for VIP management.

Human do not like to change. People will go the same shop to buy something if it's good enough. But even like that lots of people is not a VIP member of the shop. Why? Lose of trust? Waste of money? multiple reasons are there.

Maybe we connect different shop as a group, and VIP people can have great offer and special discounts in all those shops. 'ONE FOR ALL'. Those shops no need to be in the same domain. Who said is must be?
